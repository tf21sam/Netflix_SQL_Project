# Netflix_SQL_Project
#Project Overview
This project aims to conduct an extensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The primary objectives are to uncover viewer behaviors, content trends, and strategic insights that can help optimize content strategies and enhance user experience on the platform.
#Business Problems
Netflix is working with a vast dataset comprising over 82,000 rows of data from their shows and movies library. They need a robust and scalable data analytics solution to effectively analyze and extract meaningful insights from this extensive data.
#Solution Approach
To help Netflix gather valuable insights from their movies and shows dataset, I will utilize SQL and data visualization tools like Tableau. By leveraging SQL's functions, I can uncover key metrics such as viewer ratings, popularity trends, genre preferences, and viewership patterns. Once the data has been extracted and prepared, I will create interactive visualizations in Tableau to present the findings. This will enable stakeholders at Netflix to gain actionable insights through visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards.
